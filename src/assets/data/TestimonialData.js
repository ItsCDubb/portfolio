    testimonial: `Chris is one of the most amazing persons I have ever met. He is honest but with empathy and will give the best he can to support a team and individuals. Chris is a natural leader who knows how to bring out the best from everyone while being exceptionally resourceful. He is result driven and highly innovative. Chris was the first student I ran to anytime I needed help with coding. I was not surprised to learn that that many other students considered him helpful as well. I did plenty of code reviews with Chris and learned a lot from him. Chris writes amazingly clean, effective, and easy to maintain code.`,

    testimonial: `Chris is a super talented and creative software engineer and person. He is exceptional at building teams, building software, solving problems, and inspiring and motivating the people around him to succeed. I've had the pleasure of working with Chris in different circumstances and projects, and I truly appreciate the value he brings to every situation.  I'm constantly learning about a new technology, opportunity or approach to solve a problem from working with him.  Chris has the ability to envision great ideas as well as the leadership skills, actual know-how,  and practicality to bring them into reality;  which is a rare combo in my experience. He will raise the bar of performance, bring a great sense of humor, caring, and expand the knowledge of everyone on the team, quite naturally. Any innovative team would be very lucky to have him onboard.`,

    testimonial: `Mr. Chris has always been a leader and someone who sets his own records. He doesn't need anyone to teach him to love people and treat all people with respect. I had the pleasure of working alongside Chris as a career coach at Career Karma and there were many times he cheered me up on a bad day. He not only set as an example in our group but he also let us see what it's like to treat all people with Kindness because you never know what they are going through. He is a very strong programmer and any company would be glad to have him. I wish you nothing but success. `,
